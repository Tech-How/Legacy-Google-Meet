# Legacy Google Meet Project
Google is ditching the well-loved classic design of its Meet product. But I wasn't just going to sit there and watch it go by. I gathered some tools, hopped on Userstyles.org, and designed a style to bring back the classic color-scheme and fonts of Google Meet. It's currently very early in development, and constantly being worked on. Try it out and let me know what you think!
