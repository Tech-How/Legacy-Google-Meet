# Legacy Google Meet Project

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VQ9VY26/old-google-meet-colors.png"/>

Google is ditching the well-loved classic design of its Meet product. But I wasn't just going to sit there and watch it go by. I gathered some tools, hopped on Userstyles.org, and started designing a skin to bring back the classic style of Google Meet. It's currently very early in development, and constantly being worked on. Try it out and let me know what you think!

## Known Issues
- Faint blue shade appears on some clicked buttons

- Classic font applies in a few places it didn't used to

- Text-box borders under 'Report abuse' section remain blue (Cannot find the classes)

- 'More phone numbers' button missing

- Icon for the 'Auto' layout still blue

- 'Tell us more' button remains white in the troubleshooting pannel

- Some heading text appears light gray

- 'Call me' button remains white

- Some pop-ups appear right up against the control bar

- Polls, breakout rooms, Q&A, meeting streaming, and other G Suite only colors may still be blue. Sadly, I do not have my own G Suite account, so I don't have access to the necessary tools to convert the CSS code for those elements :(

- Graphs in 'Troubleshooting & help' section are still blue (I've looked forever and can't find the class associated with the graphs! If you have an idea, lemme know!)

- More of a gap between the 'You're presenting' bar and the video
