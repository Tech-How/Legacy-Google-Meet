# Legacy Google Meet Project

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qMRNy8g/old-google-meet-colors.png"/>

Google is ditching the well-loved classic design of its Meet product. But I wasn't just going to sit there and watch it go by. I gathered some tools, hopped on Userstyles.org, and designed a skin to bring back the classic style Google Meet. It's currently very early in development, and constantly being worked on. Try it out and let me know what you think!
