# Upcoming Changes

- Fix button hover colors reverting back to the incorrect ones, thanks Google! There's a lot of buttons to go through!
- Fix Google reverting the bottom bar back to black.
- Change preview screen before you join back to white.
- Revert to old border-radius of popup menu.

# Planned Projects (No Guarantee)

- Do some work on the bottom bar, make it look as close as possible to the old version. I'm not yet farmiliar with how to reposition and change the shape, aside from border radius, in CSS objects. If you think you can, please [point me in the right direction!](mailto:tech_how_youtuber55@yahoo.com)
- Revert "Auto" image in layout selection to the old green logo. I have the SVG, I just need a way to replace the image, but I'm not sure how. [Send Feedback](mailto:tech_how_youtuber55@yahoo.com)
